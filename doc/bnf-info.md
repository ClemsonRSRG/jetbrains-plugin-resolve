# BNF information, tips and tricks

Getting up and running, working-with, and keeping track of all the Jetbrains plugin support tools can make your head spin when starting development of a language plugin. The purpose of this doc is to simply point out some helpful tools for working with grammarkit .bnf style grammars, and to specify a process for prepping and maintaining the resulting grammar and lexer.

## Starting out: some helpful/required tools

First off, before doing anything, here are some **extremely** helpful (e.g.: pretty much essential) tools for doing any language plugin development work.

### Grammarkit 

[Grammarkit](https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit) is currently the only "official" Jetbrains-backed tool for custom language development. I'll leave the specifics and tutorials to the readme on the project homepage, but essentially think of this tool as a means of generating a parser that produces a reasonably expressive, robust PSI (Program Structure Interface) tree from the programs users type -- which is really (from what I have gathered) the backbone of any non-trivial language plugin. 

Install by going to `Preferences` (OSX) (or `Settings` on Windows) > `Plugins` > `Browse Repositories` Then search for "grammarkit"/"grammar", etc. Or just download and install the zip from the Jetbrains online plugin repo [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606).

|**Note: ANTLR support**|
|-------------|
|*There is now upcoming support for ANTLR grammars in Jetbrains IDEs, though at the time of writing (~December 2015) support is still pretty shaky, and many useful features necessary to building a robust PSI are still not quite there -- so keep your eye on this and we can transition at some point in the future. Though for now, we'll eat the maintainability tradeoff posed by re-writing the RESOLVE grammar in favor of the nicer PSI's generated by the official Jetbrains tools. See  [this thread](https://devnet.jetbrains.com/thread/476061?tstart=0), [this sample language plugin](https://github.com/antlr/jetbrains-plugin-sample), and of course Terence Parr's jetbrains adaptor [project page](https://github.com/antlr/jetbrains).*|

### Psi viewer

Since you're likely going to spend most of your time typing in little sample programs and staring at the PSI structure that results, the [psi viewer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227) is really helpful (follow the same installation procedure as provided for grammarkit).

Putting the caret anywhere in the editor, you can navigate through the hierarchy and check out the various properties of a given Psi node.

### Shell script plugin

To compile the JFlex lexer we'll be using, it's helpful to install a plugin that allows you to easily run bash/shell scripts through IntelliJ's GUI. I happen to use [this one](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230?pr=idea), simply because it's the one IntelliJ suggests when viewing a raw `.sh` file for the first time -- though I'm sure there are a multitude of others that work just as well too.
