# Progress Report: Designing a *Fully Featured RESOLVE IDE for Engineering Verified Software

### Abstract

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have made large strides in recent years towards making code easier to write,
navigate though, and ultimately maintain in projects of all sizes -- large and small. By providing users with immediate
feedback in the form of syntactic and semantic error annotations, context-based keyword and reference completion
suggestions, as well as a host of other transformational "housekeeping" capabilities (such as refactor/rename support), IDEs
have significantly reduced much of the burden in arriving at -- and ultimately *maintaining* -- syntactically and
semantically "competent" code. This progress report explores the integration of these and additional formal verification
related features in the context of an IDE built on top of the IntelliJ IDEA platform (*footnote*) for RESOLVE -- an
integrated programming and mathematical specification language.

### Introduction

This blend of reference completion, navigation, and template support

All the features we discuss are currently under development


### Current features

#### Mathematical glyph (unicode) support

The incorporation of a feature referred to as *live templates* makes the incorporation of user defined mathematical
glyphs easier than learning (and remembering) unicode key-combinations. Rather, to insert a particular symbol,
users

#### Keyword & reference completion

*Todo for both mathematical and programmatic contexts.

#### Integration with the RESOLVE compiler

##### Semantic error annotations
*TODO
(requires integration with the resolve compiler)

##### Code generation

#### Limited reference completion

#### Standard and user extensible library support

### Future features

#### Verification oriented

#### 'Simple' one-off features


#### Verification condition reporting

Understandability, ease of use, and modern navigational features come together to make for a promising environment for
developing modular, verified components.
