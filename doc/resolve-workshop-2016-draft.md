## Progress Report: Designing a Fully* Featured IDE for Verified Software in RESOLVE

### Abstract

Understandability, ease of use, and modern navigational features come together to make for a promising environment for
developing modular, verified components.

The usefulness of IDEs for

Toolchain for developing verified code in RESOLVE

Developing resolve code from the developer perspective. Though, these are also tools that upper class students are no
doubt unfamiliar with. And having our language easily integrateable into this existing framework

While the system being discussed is in development, we also discuss several verification-oriented features currently
under consideration such as handing the presentation of Verification Conditions (VCs) as well as
