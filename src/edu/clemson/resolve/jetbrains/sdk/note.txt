Disclaimer:
The content of the packages:
-project
-sdk
consists entirely of code from the intellij 'go' plugin located here (this applies to all
files in this package):
https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin

With this being known:
While assessing this as a potential solution for our package questions,
we're going to need to work to understand this code better if we're ultimately
going to settle on a similar approach
