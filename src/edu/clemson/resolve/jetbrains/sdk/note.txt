Disclaimer:
The content of the packages:
-project
-sdk
consists entirely of code from the intellij 'go' plugin located here (this applies to all
files in this package):
https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin

With this being known:
While assessing this as a potential solution for our package questions,
we're going to need to work to understand this code better (so we can adapt it when needed) if we're ultimately
going to settle on a similar approach
